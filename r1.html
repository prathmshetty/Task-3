    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: <br>
        the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). <br>
        They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. <br>
        Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. <br>
        The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. <br>
        Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. <br>
        The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. <br>
        African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
