    <p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;"> The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. <br>
        It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. <br>
        The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. <br>
        Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. <br>
        Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. <br>
        In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
