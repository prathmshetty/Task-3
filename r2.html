    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;"> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. <br>
        It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. <br> 
        It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. <br>
        It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. <br>
        Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. <br>
        The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.
